📈 Key Insights

Targeted promotions outperform blanket campaigns (e.g., discounts for Professionals yield +5.15% uplift).

BOGO works best for teenagers in Convenience Stores (~+4% uplift).

Toothpaste consistently generates high profits (~$4.3M) across all seasons.

Seasonal products drive demand (e.g., Ice Cream in Summer, Oranges in Winter).

Profits are evenly distributed across store types & payment methods, meaning optimization should focus on promotions and products.
